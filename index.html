                        diagonal layout based on Lorem IpsumLorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design,
                        typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content.
                        It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to
                        outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem
                        ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words
                        and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content
                        nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's
                        still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't
                        contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to
                        mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the
                        original.

                        In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a
                        publication to be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a
                        news blog that's filled with content hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to
                        be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the
                        internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements.
                        Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in
                        corporate environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early
                        1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.
